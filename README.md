- read template entry file (preferably jsx)
- transform it through some tool - vite?
- put contents to puppeteer
- save it/open browser for develop

npm run generate --template=x/y/... - run headless chrome and save pdf to file with date etc
npm run dev --template=x/y/... - open chrome with devtools

No TS, configuration is just too much for such simple project
